Wordpress ACF StarterTheme
===========================

A perfect Wordpress starting base.

A Wordpress starter theme mainly used personally for new Wordpress projects. The theme integrates the wonderful Advanced Custom Fields plugin into the theme as well as support for the premium plugins (not included). A clean LESS based stylesheet structure is also used.

## Installation
1. Copy files into a theme folder in wp-content/themes
2. Edit the style.css file and add in your details, change the theme name, etc.
3. Activate theme
4. ???
5. Profit

### Grid System Support
This starter theme comes bundled with the wonderful <a href="http://semantic.gs" target="_blank">Semantic Grid System</a>. Simply define your grid system widths and gutters in css/includes/variables.less and you're good to go. Semantic.gs uses LESS to compile code, so no messy class names, just function calls.

### Advanced Custom Fields
This theme comes pre-embedded with Advanced Custom fields in lite mode. No premium addons are included, but support for them is. Copy in your premium addons and you're good to go.

### In-built AJAX Support
Wordpress ACF Starter Theme comes with example code and support for AJAX requests the correct way including the generation of nonce keys for secure AJAX requests. See inc/ajax.php for examples and js/theme.js for examples of AJAX requests. The script has been localised with some great values and is all ready to go.
